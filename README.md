# HERMES

Hermes is a high-performance code execution engine written in Rust. It provides sandboxed, on-demand execution of arbitrary code through a simple REST API.

The system is designed for judge platforms, coding sandboxes and auto-eval services. 
It runs untrusted and potentially hostile code inside isolated environments with strict resource limits to ensure safety, predictability, and throughput.
